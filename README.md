# Steam Refurbished Tracker

This Python script utilizes Selenium to track the stock status of refurbished Steam Deck models on the Steam Store website. It checks the availability of three models (64GB, 256GB, and 512GB) and sends an email notification if any of them are in stock.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- Chrome WebDriver

You can automate the execution of this script using Windows Task Scheduler, which is the Windows equivalent of a cron job in Unix-based systems.
